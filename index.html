			<div class="box">
				This website was created to display in infographic form; the results from a series of exit interviews carried out at three pharmacies. The aims of the interviews were to identify where people get information from for OTC medicines. Moreover, discover the impact pharmacy intervention can have by looking at intentions prior to visiting the pharmacy and comparing these to purchase outcomes.

			<div class="box-heading">Introduction</div>
			<div class="box">
				Over the years NHS funding per person has decreased, and difficulty accessing a local GP has increased (Todd et al., 2015). As a result, the topic of self-care has become increasingly discussed along with the introduction of many initiatives to promote self-care.<br>
				Self-care is any action taken by an individual to maintain and improve health, which can be anything from seeking medicine information to the use of an over-the-counter (OTC) medicine.<br>
				Where people get their information from for OTC medicines can impact purchase outcomes and therefore the outcomes of self-care.
			</div>
			
			<div class="box-heading">Aim</div>
			<div class="box">
				Determine where people get information from for OTC medicines, and the impact intervention by pharmacy staff may have on self-care. 
			</div>
			
			<div class="box-heading">Method</div>
			<div class="box">
				Sixty-nine exit interviews were carried out at three pharmacies. Participants were asked a series of questions identifying reasons for visiting and where they get information from for OTC medicines. Participants that came to buy an OTC medicine were asked additional questions to identify influences for chosen OTC medicines, and the impact of discussing symptoms with pharmacy staff.

				<div class="bold">How to use</div>
				To view infographics click the <button>Buttons</button>. Key findings will apear like the following <button class="key">Button</button>.<br>
				
				<div class="bold">Responses</div>
				A majority of <button id="responses" class="show_result">participants</button> were from pharmacy 2. Most participants were from a White British <button id="responses_ethnicity" class="show_result">ethnic background</button>. There were more female participants, though <button id="responses_gender" class="show_result">not significantly</button>. Most participants were of the <button id="responses_age" class="show_result">age bands</button> 31 - 50 and 51 - 70. Apart from age 71+, each age band was fairly represented with a similar number of responses from both <button id="responses_age_gender" class="show_result">genders</button>.
				
				<div class="bold">Reasons for visiting the pharmacy</div>
				From the results most participants visited the pharmacy to <button id="reasons" class="show_result key">buy an OTC medicine or collect a prescription</button>. The reasons for visiting do not change for different <button id="age_reasons" class="show_result">age bands</button>, though non-medicinal products were only purchased by participants aged 31+.
				Differences for reasons for visiting by <button id="gender_reasons" class="show_result">gender</button> show: females were slightly more likely to buy an OTC medicine. Males were more likely to buy non-medicinal products and visiting for other reasons.
				
				<div class="bold">Intention to buy a medicine</div>
				Most participants that visited to purchase an OTC medicine <button id="bought" class="show_result key">did purchase one</button>. Most participants also visited with the intention to purchase a <button id="intention" class="show_result key">specific medicine</button>. Most participants that intended to purchase a specific medicine <button id="intention_same" class="show_result key">purchased the same one</button>, with females being more likely to <button id="intention_same_genders" class="show_result">purchase the same</button> as intended.
				
				<div class="bold">Purchase influences</div>
				Participants who visited to purchase a specific medicine were <button id="influences" class="show_result key">influenced</button> largely having used a medicine before or either by a healthcare professional or family/friend. As expected, participants that visited to purchase an OTC medicine (non-specific) were mostly <button id="influences_non" class="show_result">influenced</button> by a healthcare professional (i.e. the pharmacist).<br>
				
				Participants, having used a medicine before, found this to be a <button id="influence_used_before" class="show_result">trustworthy influence</button> for choice of medicine.<br>
				
				Over half of the participants who were recommended a medicine by a family or friend found this to be a <button id="influence_used_ff" class="show_result">trustworthy influence</button>. Though just under a half neither agreed or disagreed.<br>
				
				All participants recommended a medicine by a healthcare professional agreed or strongly agreed this was a <button id="influence_used_hcp" class="show_result">trustworthy influence</button>.
				
				<div class="bold">Discussing symptoms</div>			
				All participants that did not purchase a medicine or bought an alternative <button id="buy_not_discussed" class="show_result key">discussed symptoms</button>.							
				Participants who had used a medicine before were significantly less likely to <button id="used_before_discussed" class="show_result key">discuss symptoms</button>.
				Females were less likely to <button id="gender_discussed" class="show_result">discuss symptoms</button> compared tomales.
				As age increased participants were less likely to <button id="age_discussed" class="show_result">discuss symptoms</button>. However, older participants found discussing symptoms more <button id="symptoms_helpful" class="show_result">helpful</button>.
				Participants that intended to purchase a specific medicine recommended by a family/friend and discussed symptoms were less likely to purchase the <button id="recommeded_family_same" class="show_result key">same product</button>. 
				
				<div class="bold">Information seeking for OTC medicines</div>
				<button id="where_information" class="show_result">Where people get information from</button> for OTC medicines varies by <button id="where_information_age" class="show_result">age</button>, though there is no significant difference by <button id="where_information_gender" class="show_result">gender</button>. As <button id="where_information_age" class="show_result key">age</button> increased use of pharmacy and family/friends increased. As <button id="where_information_age" class="show_result key">age</button> decreased use of a doctor and the internet increased.

			<div class="box-heading">Discussion / Conclusion</div>
			<div class="box">
				All participants that did not buy an OTC medicine or the same as intended discussed symptoms. A study found the biggest reason for interventions OTC was due to uncertainty about uses of medicines, and providing an appropriate alternative addressed this issue in most cases (Westerlund et al., 2001).<br>
				Sixteen participants had used a medicine before, of which only three discussed symptoms. This shows pharmacy staff were less vigilant with participants who had used a medicine before. One of the three who discussed symptoms also went on to purchase an alternative medicine.<br>
				Older participants (OP) compared to younger participants (YP) were more likely to use a pharmacy for OTC medicine information; similar to findings of  Boardman et al. (2005). YPs were more likely to use the internet compared to OPs, with Kwon et al. (2015) finding OPs are less likely to trust online health information.<br>
				In most cases, there is no discussion between pharmacy staff and people who have used a medicine before. This could be an issue as it was found discussing symptoms can have a significant impact on purchase outcomes.
