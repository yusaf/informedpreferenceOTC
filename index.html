					This website was created to display in infographic form; the results from a series of exit interviews carried out at three pharmacies. The aims of the interviews were to identify where people get information from for OTC medicines. Moreover, discover the impact pharmacy intervention can have by looking at intentions prior to visiting the pharmacy and comparing these to purchase outcomes.

				<div class="group">
					This website works on modern browsers, and heavily relies on JavaScript which will need to be enabled if not already. <span class="javascript" style="color:#f00;">JavaScript is disabled.</span><br>
					
					1. At the <a href="#infographic">very bottom</a> of the page is the infographic display.<br>
					
					2. Below are sections which allow you to filter and highlight the infographic displayed at the bottom.<br>
					
					3. The section entitled "Results / preset filters" is simple to use and gives an overview of the results. Within the text are <div class="button">buttons</div> which are programmed with preset filters, and when clicked automatically changes the infographic. <br>
					
					4. The other sections are more complex and should only be used for custom filtering. Though not necessary, the "Choose columns/rows" section allows you to divide the infographic into sections based on pharmacy and demographics. The "Highlight" section allows you to highlight the infographic at the bottom based on responses to the question. To further filter the infographic, at the bottom is an <div class="button">Add Filter</div> button. Clicking this will create a new section allowing you to filter responses based on the questions asked. The <div class="button">Collapse All</div> button closes all sections taking up less room. The <div class="button">Reset Filters</div> button allows you to reset all the filters added. The <div class="button">Reset All</div> button allows you to reset the columns/rows and filters added.

							<div class="title">Responses</div>
							A majority of <button id="responses" class="show_result">participants</button> were from pharmacy 2. Most participants were from a White British <button id="responses_ethnicity" class="show_result">ethnic background</button>. There were more female participants, though <button id="responses_gender" class="show_result">not significantly</button>. Most participants were of the <button id="responses_age" class="show_result">age bands</button> 31 - 50 and 51 - 70. Apart from age 71+, each age band was fairly represented with a similar number of responses from both <button id="responses_age_gender" class="show_result">genders</button>.
							
							
							<div class="title">Reasons for visiting the pharmacy</div>
							From the results most participants visited the pharmacy to <button id="reasons" class="show_result">buy an OTC medicine or collect a prescription</button>. The reasons for visiting do not change for different <button id="age_reasons" class="show_result">age bands</button>, though non-medicinal products were only purchased by participants aged 31+.
							Differences for reasons for visiting by <button id="gender_reasons" class="show_result">gender</button> show: females were slightly more likely to buy an OTC medicine. Males were more likely to buy non-medicinal products and visiting for other reasons.
							
							
							<div class="title">Intention to buy a medicine</div>
							Most participants that visited to purchase an OTC medicine <button id="bought" class="show_result">did purchase one</button>. Most participants also visited with the intention to purchase a <button id="intention" class="show_result">specific medicine</button>. Most participants that intended to purchase a specific medicine <button id="intention_same" class="show_result">purchased the same one</button>, with females being more likely to <button id="intention_same_genders" class="show_result">purchase the same</button> as intended.
							
							
							
							
							<div class="title">Purchase influences</div>
							Participants who visited to purchase a specific medicine were <button id="influences" class="show_result">influenced</button> largely having used a medicine before or either by a healthcare professional or family/friend. As expected, participants that visited to purchase an OTC medicine (non-specific) were mostly <button id="influences_non" class="show_result">influenced</button> by a healthcare professional (i.e. the pharmacist).<br>
							
							Participants, having used a medicine before, found this to be a <button id="influence_used_before" class="show_result">trustworthy influence</button> for choice of medicine.<br>
							
							Over half of the participants who were recommended a medicine by a family or friend found this to be a <button id="influence_used_ff" class="show_result">trustworthy influence</button>. Though just under a half neither agreed or disagreed.<br>
							
							All participants recommended a medicine by a healthcare professional agreed or strongly agreed this was a <button id="influence_used_hcp" class="show_result">trustworthy influence</button>.
							
							
							
							<div class="title">Discussing symptoms</div>			
							All participants that did not purchase a medicine or bought an alternative <button id="buy_not_discussed" class="show_result">discussed symptoms</button>.							
							Participants who had used a medicine before were significantly less likely to <button id="used_before_discussed" class="show_result">discuss symptoms</button>.
							Females were less likely to <button id="gender_discussed" class="show_result">discuss symptoms</button> compared tomales.
							As age increased participants were less likely to <button id="age_discussed" class="show_result">discuss symptoms</button>. However, older participants found discussing symptoms more <button id="symptoms_helpful" class="show_result">helpful</button>.
							Participants that intended to purchase a specific medicine recommended by a family/friend and discussed symptoms were significantly less likely to purchase the <button id="recommeded_family_same" class="show_result">same product</button>. 
							
							
							<div class="title">Information seeking for OTC medicines</div>
							<button id="where_information" class="show_result">Where people get information from</button> for OTC medicines varies by <button id="where_information_age" class="show_result">age</button>, though there is no significant difference by <button id="where_information_gender" class="show_result">gender</button>. As <button id="where_information_age" class="show_result">age</button> increased use of pharmacy and family/friends increased. As <button id="where_information_age" class="show_result">age</button> decreased use of a doctor and the internet increased.
